function [M] = ThomsonMeasurements(n)
%This code creates a family of n qubit projective measurements "well spread"
%the distribution of POVM elements on the Bloch sphere comes from the ThomsonProblem
%Input: an integer n, the number of desired qubit measurements
%Output: a set of density matrices sorted as Max(:,:,a,x), where a stands for output and x for the number of inputs (goes to n)
